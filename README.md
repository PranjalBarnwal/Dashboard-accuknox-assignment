2. **Add and Remove Widgets**: Users can dynamically add or remove widgets from categories.
3. **Customizable Widgets**: Users can specify a widget name and text content when adding a new widget to a category.
4. **Search Functionality**: Users can search through a list of all available widgets.
5. **Interactive UI**: Each widget includes a cross icon for removal, and there is an add widget button for creating new widgets.
